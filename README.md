A Web Component used for playing around with media queries and iframe embeds.

Load [index.html] to see the component. The component also clones itself and puts a copy in an iframe below it...

[iframed.html] loads an iframe with src="index.html" to see what happens.

There are some log statements to see if any of the iframes can affect each other's JavaScript state. In Chrome, it looks like the answer is no. Sweet.

Also there are media queries.
